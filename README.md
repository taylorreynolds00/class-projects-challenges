# Horiseon-Test-Site-01
i started by comenting out all of my sections <nav>-<footer> and so on...

then i came to my stylesheet and comented the sections out .

while comenting the sections out i realized that my content section and the benefits section in css did not follow semantic structure of the html. so i flip floped them to the correct order

on the website i realized that the search engine optimization button was not navigating to the proper place so i added the id= search engine optimization. and there we have it now it navigates

i added a alt to the hero class.

i also added alts to the content section so screen readers will be able to identify them
i also changed the parent tags in the content section from <div> tags to <section> tags i also changed the children <div> tags to <article> tags in the content section because they are independent self-contained content

in the benefits section i changed the parent <div> tags to <section> tags

in the header section i changed the parent <div> tags of the <ul> tags to <nav> tags because it is the navigation section also in the stylesheet i changed all of the <.header> classes that had <div> tags to <nav> to keep the same style we have on the main website

Changing the title to horiseon online reputation management increases the SEO search engine optimization because i added keywords like (horiseon, and online reputation management)

in the benefit section i put the <h3> tags inside of the <img> tag to better organize the html making it look cleaner 

i applyed proper indentation to make the html more (readable)

i added a <meta> tag to the header so that the width follows the screen size of the device
